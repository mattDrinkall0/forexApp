      This platform is a scholarly project developed by a dedicated university student with a keen interest in machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and the fascinating field of stock prediction.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
      Constructed primarily as a hands-on learning venture into the depths of Svelte and JavaScript, the intention behind this project is to research and explore the exciting possibilities these technologies offer in the world of AI and Machine Learning.

      Our platform leverages the power of two major APIs. Alpha Vantage API offers comprehensive financial market data, which we utilize for stock market insights and forecasts. GNews API, on the other hand, provides us with up-to-date and relevant news articles related to the stocks in our dataset.

      It is important to note that while this platform offers stock predictions, it is intended for research and learning purposes only. It is not meant to serve as a professional financial advising tool, nor should it be used as the sole basis for making financial decisions. If you are looking for financial advice, we strongly recommend seeking guidance from a professional service.

      Thank you for your interest in our project. We are committed to continual learning and exploring the fascinating world of AI, Machine Learning, and financial technology.
